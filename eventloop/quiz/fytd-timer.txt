- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

In eventloop/timer.js:

Both foo(2) and foo(1) are called.
Synchronously, "foo" is logged, then setTimeout schedules callbacks for bar(2) and bar(1).
Synchronously, "baz" is logged.
Event loop enters the timer phase.
Both setTimeout callbacks are executed, logging "2: bar" and "1: bar" respectively.
