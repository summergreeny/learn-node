- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

The order of execution in eventloop/poll.js is:

foo() is called synchronously, logging "foo" to the console.
"done" is logged to the console synchronously.
Asynchronous file read operation is initiated.
Event loop processes the completion of the file read operation and executes its callback, logging the data or error message to the console.
