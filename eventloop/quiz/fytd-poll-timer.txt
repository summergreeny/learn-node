- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
The setTimeout callback will be queued in the event loop.
The someAsyncOperation initiates an asynchronous operation and queues its callback after the synchronous while loop.
- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
Yes, the order of execution will change. With a longer delay in the while loop, the setTimeout callback will execute before the someAsyncOperation callback.
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?
No, the order of execution won't change. setTimeout still schedules the callback asynchronously, ensuring it's queued after any currently executing code.
